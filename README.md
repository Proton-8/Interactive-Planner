<h3>-by Ron Shutter </h3><br>
<br>
<h2> What's inside </h2>
<p> The focus of this project was to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app runs in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.<br>
<br>
The following is included in this project:
<li> The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar with the current time  </li>
<li> I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours   </li>
<li> Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future  </li>
<li> I can enter an event  </li>
<li> The text for that event is saved in local storage   </li>
<li> The saved events persist  </li>

</p>
